# Privacy Policy for ArraySpy

ArraySpy is a development tool designed to help developers debug array operations in JavaScript. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

1. **Local Storage**: The extension uses Chrome's local storage to save your preferences for which array methods you want to track. This data never leaves your browser.

2. **Array Tracking**: The extension tracks array transformations in the JavaScript code you're debugging. This tracking:
   - Only occurs on the pages you visit
   - Is only visible to you through your browser's console
   - Does not send any data to external servers
   - Does not persist beyond your current browser session

3. **No Data Sharing**: We do not collect, store, or share any of your data with third parties.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `storage`: To save your preferences
- `activeTab`: To update array tracking in the current tab
- `host_permissions`: To work on any website where you need to debug array operations

## Your Control

You can:
- Disable the extension at any time
- Clear your preferences through Chrome's extension settings
- Restrict which websites the extension can access through Chrome's extension settings

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue in the extension's GitHub repository.
